## Hierarchical Modular Structure of the _Drosophila_ Connectome 

This is a repository for the work of  Alexander B. Kunin, Jiahao Guo, Kevin E. Bassler, Xaq Pitkow, and Krešimir Josić, studying network community structure of the [Hemibrain](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flyem/hemibrain) data set. This is a companion to our manuscript, available as a preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.23.517722v1). The notebooks and data we used to produce the figures in the paper are [on github](https://github.com/josiclab/flybrain-clustering).

From here, you can view interactive versions of figures from our paper, which allow for more detailed inspection of certain elements. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Alex Kunin.
