## Fly Hemibrain Community Analysis

This is a repository for ongoing work between Alex Kunin, Jiahao Guo, Kevin Bassler, Xaq Pitkow, and Krešimir Josić, studying network community properties of the [Fly Hemibrain](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flyem/hemibrain) data set. For now, we can share a few figures in the [gallery](gallery.md).
